This is my portflio site.
This site includes information about me and my experience with sofwtare engineering. 
Additionally, it showcases my projects that I have completed and I am currently working on. I hope to add more to this page. 

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build this site. 

HTML:
The site structure is built with HTML.

CSS:
The colors, positions, and overall display is done with CSS.

I used some CSS hover effects to change the color of my name (browswer version only) and to make the menu buttons spin on the browswer and the footer menu buttons spin
on the mobile version. 

jQuery:
I used jQuery to...

-change the size of my hello button to reveal a photo underneath. 

-to make a menu hamburger - a hidden menu is shown when the hamburger is clicked. 

-to create a modal that shows my resume for a quick view of it if someone doesn't want to download my resume. 

-to create an accordion that reveals picture and recipe info of pizzas I've made when you click on each one. 

unsolved problems:
-I tried to add an api call to retrieve a random quote but couldn't get it to work. I got help from two TAs who also couldn't get it to work. I tried setting up a different api call for random photos of dogs and that didn't work either. Trying again but not optimistic. 

-trying to get my choose your adventure game done - need to figure out the different scenarios and how it will play out and eventually ened. 

-castle battle. I just can't get the right sequence of things to happen and I think the code is not so DRY in some places.
