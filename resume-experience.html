                        <h5>General Assembly - Software Engineering Immersive Student</h5>
                    <p>The Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly is a 3 month’s long program that teaches those enrolled the basics of full-stack development. From frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to backend building and maintaining servers.</p>
                    <h5>Shannon's Rotisserie, Inc. - Office Manager</h5>
                    <p>As Office Manager I was in charge of bookkeeping, simple accounting, payroll and employee paperwork/organization. I work closely with both owners and management in order to ensure proper procedures are followed and so that the back office can reconcile and track sales accurately. </p>
                    <h5>LSUHSC Cell Biology and Anatomy - Research Associate</h5>
                    <p>Following receipt of my Master’s Degree I was hired to work in the lab of Jason Middleton, PhD. His work focused on studying electrical properties of specific cell subtypes in the primary auditory coritces of mice. I was the first to join his lab and not only learned and executed his experimental techniques but helped with lab organization and placing orders for lab materials. I then trained both his incoming graduate student as well as my replacement.</p>
                    <h5>Style 2 Salon - Receptionist and Owner's Assistant</h5>
                    <p>In the interim of my Master’s graduation and my employment with LSUHSC I worked part time at a local hair salon. I worked with sales representatives for orders, scheduled clients, and helped with cleaning and organizing the salon products. I also worked as the assistant to the owner of the salon.</p>
                    <h5>Education - Tulane University</h5>
                    <p>At Tulane University, I discovered the field of Neuroscience and applied and was accepted to work in the lab of Dr. Gary Dohanich for 3 years at Tulane. This gave me the opportunity to apply what I learned in the classroom with hands on lab work. Another positive outcome was the mentorship from the graduate students as well as our principal investigator, Dr. Dohanich.</p>
                    <p>After graduating with my Bachelor’s degree I was accepted into Tulane’s 4+1 Master’s Program. With the guidance of Dr. Dohanich and his doctorate students I completed my Master’s Thesis entitled, “Learning-Induced Changes in Muscarinic Receptor Binding Density as a Function of Cognitive Strategy.” </p>
